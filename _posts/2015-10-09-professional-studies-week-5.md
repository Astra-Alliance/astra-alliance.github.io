This week the Astra cohort were split into two groups to visit different schools specialising in educational needs in Buckinghamshire, the non DCGS trainees were invited to Alfriston School, a school of approximately 120 girls with moderate learning disabilities. After a brief introduction to the school's ethos we had a session on wellbeing in schools, lead by Charlene Cheung, who has a background in psychology and mental health. The session explored how student's well being directly affects their learning and vice versa, that academic success has a positive impact on their life satisfaction. 

Following from this we broke into subject related pairs to observe small segments of two lessons, this provided an enlightening insight to how different lessons were from those in mainstream schools. A significant difference was the class sizes, maths consisted of just six pupils! To conclude the afternoon we spoke about language and communication with Margaret Dean, a well established teacher at the school. Margaret shared some ideas and methods she uses to encourage the girls to develop in these areas including questioning prompts and role playing.

We all left with plenty to think about and were surprised to realise that a fair amount of what we had discussed was transferable to the schools that we're currently placed in. Although there were obvious differences it was intriguing to see that many aspects of school life and pupils experiences were not that dissimilar to mainstream schools.
