You are required to complete an _Opening Position Statement_ when you begin your course. If you haven't done this yet, please go and do it!

  

>Your Opening Position Statement may take the form of a series of brief paragraphs or, if you prefer, a number of bullet points addressing the following questions: 

> * What knowledge and expertise am I bringing with me to the training year that will be relevant to teaching? 
> * What opportunities do I expect there to be on the course to utilise and develop my existing knowledge and expertise? 
> * What personal qualities do I already have that will help me in the training year? 
> * What areas of subject knowledge do I feel I need to develop through the training year in order to prepare me for a career in teaching? 
> * What action do I intend to take by way of preparing myself for the training year? 
> * What personal targets do I intend to set myself for the year to come? 
> * What are my current expectations of, attitudes towards and feelings about the forthcoming training year
