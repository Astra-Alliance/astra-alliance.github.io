The <abbr title="Reassure, Establish, Visit, Input, Emphasise, What">REVIEW</abbr> framework comprises a set of suggestions and associated guidance. It is designed to help mentors and colleagues give you feedback about your performance and teaching in a constructive and helpful way.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
	  <th>Stages</th>
      <th>Comments</th>
      <th>Sample Statements/Questions</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
		<td><strong>R</strong>: Reassure and Re-integrate</td>
		<td>Reassure without letting APT know your thoughts; even if they know you thought some teaching was effective they still have to work out what!</td>
		<td>Thank you.  There was some really effective work there…</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
		<td><strong>E</strong>: Establish focus on Objectives</td>
		<td>Personal goals may be relevant at the start of the programme; as teacher grows, focus must fall on pupil learning.</td>
		<td>
			+ What did you want to achieve yourself?
			+ What was your personal goal?
			+ What did you want the group to learn?
		</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
		<td><strong>V</strong>: Visit through Questions</td>
		<td>Get APT to think about importance of lesson plan to success or otherwise of lesson

			Link questions to specific Q Standards, particularly those that were a focus of the lesson and part of the RPT’s targets

			OR depending on the RPT a much more open ended approach can be used and they can set the agenda. Note strength of answers - assessment</td>
		<td>
			<ul>
				<li>In trying to achieve your outcomes how helpful was your lesson plan?</li>
				<li>What went well with regard to....?</li>
				<li>What else went well?</li>
				<li>What about... how did that go?</li>
				<li>If you had the opportunity to do it again:</li>
				<li>What would you do differently?</li>
				<li>What didn’t go to plan?</li>
				<li>What were you less happy about?</li>
			</ul>
		</td>
    </tr>
	<tr>
		<td><strong>I</strong>: Input – your own Contribution</td>
		<td>If the APT has run out of ideas (frustrated at questioning) move to more direct ‘leading’ (telling).</td>
		<td>
			<ul>
				<li>What about...?</li>
				<li>What else...?</li>
				<li>How else...?</li>
				<li>How could that have been achieved?</li>
			</ul>
		</td>
    </tr>
	<tr>
		<td><strong>E</strong>: Emphasise and Summarise key points raised</td>
		<td></td>
		<td>Lots of useful points there – Let me try to summarise them for you…… (briefly pick out the key issues)</td>
    </tr>
	<tr>
		<td><strong>W</strong>: “What have you learnt?” / “What will you now do?”</td>
		<td></td>
		<td>Ask the APT the questions and try to nail precisely what they will do with what they have learnt to take them forward in the next lesson.</td>
