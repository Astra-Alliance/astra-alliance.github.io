**Professional Studies Week 9**

**Working with External Agencies (reflection on Positive behaviour management), facilitated by Rachel Appleyard and Dave Pollitt from The Misbourne**

This week, the Astra trainees returned to **The Misbourne School** for a follow-up session on Behaviour Management, facilitated by Mr David Pollitt (Assistant Headteacher). The focus for this session was on "Working with external agencies" as well as a return to the topic of ?positive behaviour management?. Starting the session with some invaluable information on important external agencies we may come across during our teaching careers such as CAHBS, HMI and SIP and how we can utilise the support they provide.

We also focused on working with parents, breaking into small groups to discuss our own experiences or observations of teachers interacting with parents of students. This, like so much of our professional development, allowed for an insight into one and others training experience and an understanding of the various tactics that must be used in order to build a professional working relationship with parents and guardians. David put it brilliantly by saying we should treat parents like "stakeholders in a business", and that we need to remember at all times that our students are their parents most prized possessions.

To finish the session, David asked us reflect on the training session he gave us back in September, Positive Behaviour Management, and asked for feedback on the core routines we have set in place during our first term teaching. Reflecting in this manner, through group discussions, allowed us to share stories and see how we all approach teaching in slightly different ways, across various schools and subjects, but it is clear that core routines are something we have all developed quickly. Our final note was a challenge: with only one week remaining at our first placement, David wanted us to consider what we would try to include in our routines during our final week in our first placement.

This was another extremely valuable session to exchange experiences and learn from experts in our field.  On behalf of all the trainees, I would like to thank **David Pollitt, Rachel Appleyard and The Misbourne School** for hosting us!
