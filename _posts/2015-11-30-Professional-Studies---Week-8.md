**Professional Studies - Week 8**

CSEC and Wycombe Grange PRU visits

As with the nature of a Pupil Referral unit, each one of our visits was completely different, which was possibly one of the greatest things about it. The first group in our divided cohort of trainees arrived for briefing at CSEC, the new build centre in Chesham.

As we were given our timetables and a brief run down of the day, it was easy to notice how spacious and friendly the building was, all the teachers and students who had already arrived were sat together having breakfast. We were told that for some of the students, coming to school would be the only way of them eating a nutritious meal and that it was vital that it was offered twice a day. The day felt rather sporadic, with it being the new term there were less students than there would be ending the school year, also with half term fast approaching there was also an absence of students who simply didn't want to come in. The plus side to this was the small class sizes which meant that teachers could really focus on how to help each student individually in their chosen subject, a luxury that teachers in mainstream schools rarely get.

We were able to visit a range of classes and each have a very individual experience to the day. One thing that was very valuable to our experience there was witnessing the importance of support staff in this kind of education environment. Students benefited a lot from having so many extra staff for pastoral reasons which seemed to be of more importance than perhaps the teaching in comparison to the mainstream schools that we are used to.

The next day we attended the Wycombe Grange. Structurally the building had a completely different atmosphere. The entire school was encompassed inside a Victorian family house which led to a very friendly environment and meant that if there were any issues with students, support staff were there immediately.

Overall I think it's very safe to say that all the trainees felt very welcome and had a very valuable experience on our short days with both CSEC and the Wycombe grange. The environment and staffing was a change to what we are used to but a terrifically interesting perspective to add to our training year.
