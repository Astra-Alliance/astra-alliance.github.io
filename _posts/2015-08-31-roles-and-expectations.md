<strong>Trainee / Reading Partnership Teacher (RPT)</strong>

RPTs are responsible for their own professional development and should take a growing responsibility; a full person specification and role description are given in Appendix 3 of the Reading Uni <abbr title="Manual of Guidance">MOG</abbr>.

<strong>School-based subject mentor</strong>
The Mentor is responsible for supporting, guiding and coaching the RPT in their work within the school. The Mentor adjusts the training programme in school to meet the individual needs of the RPT, liaising with other members of the department to ensure consistency of approach. A description of the role of the Mentor is provided in Appendix 4 of the <abbr title="Manual of Guidance">MOG</abbr>.
The REVIEW model of feedback has been developed to support Mentors in encouraging RPTs to reflect on their teaching and take ownership of their development. It is important that RPTs seek to understand their practice rather than to imitate role models.

<strong>School-based Initial Teacher Training Co-ordinator (ITTCo)</strong>
The ITTCo is responsible for organising and quality assuring Initial Teacher Training in the school. A description of the role is provided in Appendix 6.

<strong>Reading University Staff</strong>

<strong>Subject Tutor</strong>
The Subject Tutor is responsible for quality assurance, Mentor support and training, and sharing in the continuous assessment of the RPT.  The tutor will visit the RPT three times during the year, the second occasion being in the Second Placement. The principal purpose of these visits is to monitor the consistency of the Mentoring across the partnership and to support the development of the Mentor as a Teacher Educator.  Tutors will provide feedback to Mentors as well as to the RPT, following observation of teaching and feedback as well as a review of paperwork.

<strong>The Personal Tutor</strong>
In most cases the Personal Tutor will be the same person as the Subject Tutor, but for subjects with a large cohort this might not always be possible. The Personal Tutor will meet with RPTs for an hour-long group tutorial once a term (possibly split over several sessions). This will be an opportunity to discuss any concerns or questions about the programme.

<strong>The Professional Studies Tutor</strong>
All RPTs will be allocated to a cross-subject Professional Studies group for the university-based Professional Studies days. This group will be led by the Professional Studies Tutor.

<strong>The Subject Leader</strong>
The Subject Leader is responsible for coordinating the subject-based teaching at the University, for allocating school placements for the University-based PGCE, for liaising with the team of Subject Tutors and Personal Tutors for subjects with larger cohorts and for the evaluation of school-based and university provision in the subject. Questions or issues that can’t be dealt with by Subject Tutors can be escalated to Subject Leaders.

<strong>The Lead Tutor</strong>
Lead Tutors are responsible for managing the university’s relationship with a school or a group of schools.

<strong>The ITT Administration Team</strong>
The ITT Administration Team ensures the smooth running of the programme.

<strong>The Programme Director</strong>
The Programme Director is responsible for the smooth operation of the School Direct and university-based PGCE and QTS Programmes and for the quality of the outcomes.
