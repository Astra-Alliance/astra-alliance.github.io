<strong>Trainee / Astra Partnership Teacher (APT)</strong>

APTs are responsible for their own professional development and should take a growing responsibility; 

<strong>School-based subject mentor</strong>
The Mentor is responsible for supporting, guiding and coaching the APT in their work within the school. The Mentor adjusts the training programme in school to meet the individual needs of the APT, liaising with other members of the department to ensure consistency of approach. 
The REVIEW model of feedback has been developed to support Mentors in encouraging RPTs to reflect on their teaching and take ownership of their development. It is important that APTs seek to understand their practice rather than to imitate role models.

<strong>School-based Initial Teacher Training Co-ordinator (ITTCo)</strong>
The ITTCo is responsible for organising and quality assuring Initial Teacher Training in the school. 


<strong>Visiting Tutor</strong>
The Visiting Tutor is responsible for quality assurance, Mentor support and training, and sharing in the continuous assessment of the APT.  The tutor will visit the APT three times during the year, the second occasion being in the Second Placement. The principal purpose of these visits is to monitor the consistency of the Mentoring across the partnership and to support the development of the Mentor as a Teacher Educator.  Tutors will provide feedback to Mentors as well as to the APT, following observation of teaching and feedback as well as a review of paperwork.

<strong>The Subject Tutor</strong>
In most cases the Subject Tutor will be the same person as the Visiting Tutor, but for subjects with a large cohort this might not always be possible. The Subject Tutor is responsible for coordinating the subject-based teaching and will meet with APTs for full day group tutorials once per half-term. This will be an opportunity to discuss any concerns or questions about the programme.


<strong>The SCITT Director</strong>
The SCITT Director is responsible for managing Astraâ€™s relationship with the Partnership Schools.

<strong>The ITT Administration Team</strong>
The ITT Administration Team ensures the smooth running of the programme.

<strong>The Teacher Training Manager</strong>
The Teacher Training Manager is responsible for the smooth operation of the QTS Programme and for the quality of the outcomes.
