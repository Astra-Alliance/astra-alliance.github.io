The third session of our in-school Professional Studies programme was held at The Misbourne School on 24th September 2015, bringing together all 16 of the Astra trainees from across 7 partner schools. It was a timely and welcome opportunity to focus on __behaviour management and differentiation__.  Mr Dave Pollitt, the Misbourne’s Assistant Headteacher for Inclusion, kicked off proceedings by revealing the best strategies he has found for behaviour management over his extensive career.  As you can imagine, all trainees leaned in very closely in order to soak up the wisdom of his experience and advice!

In particular, he talked about how to __balance your personality with the ethos of a school__. There was a strong emphasis placed on the need to model the behaviour you want to see from your pupils; dressing smartly, remaining calm and keeping promises clearly make a big difference to pupil behaviour. Refreshingly, he made it clear that, as a teacher, you need to be confident and be yourself - you can’t fake it as a teacher for 39 weeks a year!

Time passed very quickly during the two hour session, and before we knew it, some Sixth Form volunteers came in to __act out some common challenges teachers face in the classroom__ - a truly dramatic and engaging approach! After each scene there was a useful opportunity to discuss how you might respond if that was happening in your classroom. It became clear that everyone would handle things differently, but it was an invaluable chance to compare and contrast how people might respond.

To round off the afternoon, __we broke out into subject groups and shared ideas on differentiated activities__. This opportunity to share best practice allowed everyone to pick up practical ideas and also acted as a reminder of the need to continually learn from each other.

On behalf of the Astra cohort, I would like to __thank Rachel Appleyard and Dave Pollitt__ for organising and facilitating such a valuable and useful session at The Misbourne.
