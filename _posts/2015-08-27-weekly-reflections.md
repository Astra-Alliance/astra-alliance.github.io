Every week (during your main and secondary placements) you are required to submit a 'Weekly Reflections on Progress' report.<!--more--> 

The __WROP__ is as a requirement of Reading University and, as such, it will be explained in your University-based sessions in much more detail.

To make the process easier, we have an online system for submitting these WROPs. By filling in [this form](https://docs.google.com/a/astra-alliance.com/forms/d/1HgMj0te2U-UdqYvKB0Y4DTmUSJ4EIFOTeK9lksentbQ/viewform) on a weekly basis, your WROP will automatically be saved to Google Drive for you (you'll receive an email with the document, and it'll appear in your 'Shared with Me'). A copy will also be emailed (as a Word Document) to your Reading Tutor, your school ITTCo and your mentors. Our system also allows us to keep track of when these forms are submitted, helping us to help you to stay organised and on top of this important process.

Please make sure we have the contact details for your Reading Tutor (name & email address) at the start of term so we can make sure the automation works as smoothly as possible!

If you have any questions, feel free to get in touch via the normal channels.
