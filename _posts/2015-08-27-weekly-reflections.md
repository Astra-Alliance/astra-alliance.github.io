Every week (during your main & second-school placements) you are required to submit a '_Weekly Reflections on Progress_' report. The <abbr title="Weekly Reflection on Progress">WROP</abbr> is as a requirement of your course with Reading University. As such, it will be explained in your University-based sessions in much more detail.

To make the process easier, we have an online system for submitting these WROPs. We would like you to fill in [this form](https://docs.google.com/a/astra-alliance.com/forms/d/1HgMj0te2U-UdqYvKB0Y4DTmUSJ4EIFOTeK9lksentbQ/viewform) on a weekly basis instead of creating and editing a new document each time. By doing this, your WROP will automatically be saved to Google Drive as a Google Doc for you (you'll receive an email with a link to the document, and it'll appear in your 'Shared with Me'). A copy will also be emailed (as a 'Word Document') to your Reading Tutor, your school ITTCo and your mentor(s). Our system also allows us to keep track of when these forms are submitted, helping us to help you to stay organised and on top of this important process.

The form itself is simple, concise and straightforward, comprising of an evaluation of the past week and a section allowing you to set targets for the upcoming one. As with all online forms, you should know or have prepared what you want to write in advance of filling it in on screen (e.g. it's a submission process, not an editing one). Once you've submitted the form, you won't be able to make any changes as the emails will have been automatically sent.

To help us ensure that the automation works as smoothly as possible, please make sure we have the contact details for your Reading Tutor (name & email address) at the start of term. If you have any questions about this, or any other matters, feel free to get in touch via the normal channels.
