**PROFESSIONAL STUDIES - WEEK 7**

The focus of this week's session was on reflection - specifically how our recent experiences at the [Wycombe Grange, the Chesham Skills & Enterprise Centre](http://www.thewycombegrange.com/) and the [Alfriston School ](http://www.alfristonschool.com/)could inform and improve our practice during our training year. As previous posts demonstrate, these educational environments differ substantially from our current placement schools, but present opportunities and challenges we could easily utilise and encounter during our teaching careers.

In order to provide a degree of structure to our reflections, and to ensure the we had the opportunity to compare our own ideas with one another, we broke down into a collection four-person groups. Each group was tasked with the production of a short presentation, containing an analysis of our collective reflections, which we then presented to other groups during the latter half of the session.

Both within groups and across groups, reflections were both strikingly similar and remarkably different. Common across all the groups were the preconceptions we had before going into the pupil referral unit in particular; negative and slightly stereotypical opinions had clearly been misplaced!  All groups expressed the reality that many of our preconceptions were completely inaccurate! Differences between groups focused upon the very wide variety of our observations - each of us have been able to select a number of different personal experiences which have enabled us to build upon our practice. Sharing these insights was particularly helpful, allowing us to benefit from the strength of each other's insights.

It was greatly beneficial to have this chance to share our thoughts with one another. As we have come to understand since the beginning of this course, teaching is a profession where both reflection and working together are central to ensuring outstanding outcomes. Today's session demonstrated both brilliantly, and I would like to take the opportunity of thanking Andrew Millar for chairing the session, as well as colleagues from the pupil referral unit and Alfriston Special School for giving up their valuable time to work with us.
