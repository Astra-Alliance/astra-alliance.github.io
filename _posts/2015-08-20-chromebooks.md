Hopefully you have been using your Chromebook over the summer break and have been gaining some confidence in using it.

As many of the systems and applications we rely on every day migrate into 'the cloud', to get the best out of the device, you should try to use as many of the online services we offer as possible. At DCGS, all our teaching staff have been issued with Chromebooks to replacing an aging 'Windows' laptop fleet. The speed of access, coupled with long battery life, has meant that they've been broadly welcomed as an ideal device for classroom teaching and to help interact with students outside lessons as well.

If you need further resources, or help/guidance, on the Chrome platform, you can visit the [Chromebook Help Centre](https://support.google.com/chromebook).

Some of the most useful time-saving tricks to learn are 'keyboard shortcuts'. You can find a list of these [Shortcuts online](https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/183101?hl=en-GB).

For those trainees who are starting their placements at schools other than DCGS, you should try to find time to go and introduce yourself to your on-site technical support team. They should be able to help connect you up to the school wifi. If you need any help with this, feel free to get them to email us back at '<em>Astra HQ</em>' and we can hopefully assist.

If you find yourself (later in term) needing to use your Chromebooks to project in classrooms, then we have <abbr title="High-Definition Multimedia Interface">HDMI</abbr> -> <abbr title="Video Graphics Array">VGA</abbr> convertor 'dongles' available for you to use. This converts between the output socket on your chromebooks and the input on most projector room set-ups. If you'd like to borrow one during the year, just drop into IT4 (at DCGS) and see any of the staff there.

As ever, if you have any queries or need any particular help/training, please feel free to get in touch via the normal channels (e.g. email or come find someone in IT4 when you're at DCGS).
