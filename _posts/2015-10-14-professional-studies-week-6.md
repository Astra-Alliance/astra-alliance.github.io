###VISIT TO THE GRANGE SCHOOL, AYLESBURY - FOCUS ON ENGLISH AS AN ADDITIONAL LANGUAGE (EAL)

Our visit to the Grange School for Professional Studies was both illuminating and thought-provoking. Trainees at Dr Challoner’s Grammar School and Dr Challoner’s High School were invited to observe a year 8 mathematics lesson, described by colleagues at The Grange as a “challenging class”, which also possessed two EAL students. A specialised EAL support staff member was present, and it was her primary responsibility to ensure the EAL students were all on task - this is in sharp contrast to Challoner’s lessons, where no teaching assistants are employed.  This provided an opportunity to see how learning support assistants worked alongside the class teacher in order to ensure students were all learning and able to achieve.

After the observation, we moved into a conference room, and a colleague who is Head of EAL gave a presentation on the wide range of strategies/management techniques employed by The Grange to help facilitate the particular students. This was hugely useful, particularly at this stage of our training, as many of the strategies used to assess knowledge and understanding were absolutely relevant to lesson planning in general.  As Mr Millar (our ITTCO) put it, it was a masterclass in how to plan and deliver outstanding teaching and learning.  Therefore, this professional studies session undoubtedly enhanced our current teaching practice, giving us new ideas and approaches for both EAL management, and classroom management as a whole.  The visit also helped us to understand the part of Teachers’ Standard Number 5, which demands that we “have a clear understanding of the needs of all pupils, including those with English as an additional language … and be able to use and evaluate distinctive teaching approaches to engage and support them.”

On behalf of the trainees, I would like to thank the EAL team at The Grange, as well as Ms Brown and Ms Williams on the SLT who helped to co-ordinate our visit.
