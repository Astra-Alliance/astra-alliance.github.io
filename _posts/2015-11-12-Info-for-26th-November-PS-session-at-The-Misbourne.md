The Professional Studies session on 26th November will be at The Misbourne, and will be "Follow up Behaviour Management Session, Contact with parents & Working with other adults and external agencies ".

In advance of this session, Rachel Appleyard of The Misbourne has asked to get some feedback so that they can prepare a purposeful session.  Could you therefore please reflect on the following questions and send your responses to her directly at rappleyard@bucksgfl.org.uk by Wednesday 18th November (though the earlier the better please!)

1. What challenging behaviour have you witnessed?

2. Is there a scenario or two that you have seen that you would be able to share and discuss how it was handled?  What was the scenario?

3. What contact have you had with parents?

4. What prior knowledge do you have of external agencies that link with schools?
